# 用 Wav2Vec2 抄写诗歌和演讲

> 原文：<https://towardsdatascience.com/transcribing-poetry-and-speeches-with-wav2vec2-2658c6510f06?source=collection_archive---------30----------------------->

## 迄今为止，音频文件的有效转录一直是现代 NLP 中主要的“缺失环节”之一。进入拥抱脸的脸书 Wav2Vec2 模型的实现，它产生了令人印象深刻的开箱即用的结果。

![](img/b74a1c830ff2d6dada506c0a7574d07b.png)

2021 年 1 月 20 日，诗人阿曼达·戈尔曼发表就职诗。通过 [PBS NewsHour 的 YouTube 剪辑](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ055ilIiN4)截屏。

AI 自己写不出伟大的诗歌(还不行？).但是它现在可以很好地转录诗歌朗诵，如果从 [Wav2Vec2 变压器模型](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/wav2vec2.html)得到的结果是什么的话。

我使用长度从 62 秒到 12.5 分钟不等的音频剪辑进行了测试，包括青年诗人阿曼达·戈尔曼的令人回味的[就职诗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ055ilIiN4)，结果令人印象深刻。

高效的音频到文本转录是现代自然语言处理(NLP)工具包中“缺失的环节”之一。现在看来不再是了，这要归功于拥抱脸对脸书的 Wav2Vec2 模型的实现。

令人兴奋的是，它开辟了从音频文件到文本情感分析甚至翻译的“链式链接”NLP 任务的新可能性。这里需要注意的是，长音频剪辑以这种方式处理时确实是内存密集型的，对于没有超级电脑的人(比如我)来说需要额外的工作。

这篇文章概述了我最近试验的结果，并包括一个 [repo](https://github.com/chuachinhon/wav2vec2_transformers) 的链接，里面有笔记本和样本文件来运行你自己的试验。你可以在这里查看两个长片段[的输出结果。](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/evmoflm2w3a1zo1/AAAbKTt2fL45Sf8lIOS7RuJwa?dl=0)

# 回购、要求和参考

我的 [repo](https://github.com/chuachinhon/wav2vec2_transformers) 包含 3 个笔记本(2 个 Jupyter，1 个 Colab)和 3 套音频文件。要运行它们，您需要:

*   [变压器≥ 4.3](https://pypi.org/project/transformers/)
*   [Librosa](https://pypi.org/project/librosa/) (管理音频文件)

repo 中的[音频文件已被拆分并向下采样至 16kHz。如果您希望使用自己的音频剪辑，请确保它们以 16kHz 采样，因为这是 Wav2Vec2 基本模型预先训练和微调的频率。](https://github.com/chuachinhon/wav2vec2_transformers/tree/main/audio)

每个音频剪辑应该有多长？这将取决于你所能处理的计算量。Wav2Vec2 转录过程非常占用内存。试图转录超过 90 秒的音频文件都崩溃了，即使是在 Colab Pro 上。

因此，我将音频剪辑保持在最大 60 秒左右。要处理较长的音频片段，你必须将它们分成相等的部分，每部分一分钟(或者你的机器可以处理的任何东西)。我们稍后再讨论这个。

在我的试验中，我使用了 [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) 来分割音频文件。它是免费的，对于手头的任务来说绰绰有余。

在这篇文章中，我不会深入讨论技术细节。但是关于 Wav2Vec2 的文档和论文值得一读:

*   关于[拥抱脸](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/wav2vec2.html)的文档
*   关于 wav2vec 2.0 的论文:语音表示的自我监督学习框架
*   托管推理[拥抱面上的 API](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h)

在 Hugging Face 的 model hub 上有几个版本的 Wav2Vec2 模型。对于这个练习，我坚持使用 [wav2vec2-base-960h](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h) 基本型号。

# 尝试 1:“问问你能为你的国家做些什么”

![](img/8cbf4f2ff14ad52f0a4e70a346fe19a9.png)

1961 年 1 月 20 日，美国前总统约翰·肯尼迪发表就职演说。通过 JFK 总统图书馆和博物馆网站上的视频截图。

试用 Wav2Vec2 的最简单方法是使用一个小的音频剪辑，该剪辑对于模型来说可以相对快速地一次性转录。我从已故美国总统约翰·肯尼迪 1961 年著名的就职演说(第 13 分钟开始)中挑选了一个 62 秒的片段，这是 Wav2Vec2 的文字记录:

> 在漫长的世界历史中，只有少数几代人被赋予在自由面临最大危险时捍卫自由的职责。我不会逃避这一职责，我欢迎这一职责。我不相信我们中的任何人会与任何其他民族或任何其他一代人交换位置。**王锷为此付出的精力、信念和奉献精神将会使我们的国家和整个世卫组织为之服务 那团火发出的光芒**和**真的**像**世界，所以我的美国同胞**不要问你的国家能为你做什么，问你能为你的国家做什么****

Wav2Vec2 抄本中的粗体部分是有问题的部分。总的来说，在我看来，结果令人印象深刻。但是，在一个更长的音频剪辑中，如果说话的口音和节奏发生变化，该模型将如何表现呢？

# 试验 2:“我们攀登的山”

![](img/c63f4506df14711c78779c854e103be5.png)

2021 年 1 月 20 日，诗人阿曼达·戈尔曼发表就职诗。通过 [PBS NewsHour 的 YouTube 剪辑](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ055ilIiN4)截屏。

为了与第一次审判形成鲜明对比的第二次审判，我提前 40 年跳到另一个美国总统就职典礼，并挑选了一个 5 分 34 秒的阿曼达·戈尔曼在美国国会大厦的台阶上发表一首美丽而令人回味的诗的片段。

然而，试图一次转录 334s 片段被证明是徒劳的，内存不足的问题反复破坏了我的笔记本。我最终找到了一个简单但笨拙的解决办法，将原始剪辑分成更小的 35 个剪辑，一次转录一个。见本[笔记本](https://github.com/chuachinhon/wav2vec2_transformers/blob/main/notebooks/2.0_wav2vec2_poetry.ipynb)。

这是来自 Wav2Vec2 的[文字记录](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zx4bfct1zhl18az/amanda_gorman.txt?dl=0):

AND BEAUTIFUL WHEN DAY COMES WE STEP OUT OF THE SHADE AFLAME AND UNAFRAID THE NEW DAWN BALLOONS AS WE FREE IT FOR THERE WAS ALWAYS LIGHT IF ONLY WERE BRAVE ENOUGH TO SEE IT IF ONLY **WERE** BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE IT
```

同样，粗体部分是模型没有正确处理的有问题的部分。但是我认为这些都是很小的问题，很容易解决。随着 Wav2Vec2 模型变得更加复杂，我非常肯定结果会更好。

# 试验三:新加坡和 WEF

![](img/211cd366d88504a63d63be43d95d3dcd.png)

通过[新加坡总理办公室的 YouTube 频道截屏。](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izrdoAm4_Gw)

在第三次试验中，我想在一个超过 10 分钟的剪辑上评估这个模型，这个剪辑的特点是一个说话者带有亚洲口音。我选定了 2021 年 1 月 29 日新加坡总理李显龙在世界经济论坛达沃斯议程周的演讲。

这一次，我把 12 分钟 30 秒的演讲分成了 13 个部分(12 个 60 秒的片段和 1 个 30 秒的片段)，并在 [Colab Pro](https://github.com/chuachinhon/wav2vec2_transformers/blob/main/notebooks/2.1_wav2vec2_colab.ipynb) 上运行。《T2》的剧本花了 2 分钟 4 秒制作完成:

按照前两次试验，粗体部分表示有问题的地方。演讲中有很多技术术语，很明显是模型出错了，就像总理对一些单词的发音一样。

这次需要做更多的清理工作。但是这花了 2 分钟 4 秒。想一想手动抄写演讲稿可以节省多少时间。

Wav2Vec2 的转录本无论如何都不是完美的。对于某些用例来说，缺少标点符号可能是一个问题，音频剪辑的管理需要额外的资源。

但是考虑到所有的事情，我会说 Wav2Vec2 模型在 NLP 中开辟了令人兴奋的新的可能性，不仅仅是快速和准确的转录。我对通过其他 transformer 模型将抄本用作翻译、情感分析或摘要的输入的前景感到特别兴奋。

这会变得非常有趣。
